# Toy robot test

The application is a simulation of a toy robot moving on a square tabletop, of dimensions 5 units x 5 units.

There are no other obstructions on the table surface.

The robot is free to roam around the surface of the table, but must be prevented from falling to destruction. Any movement
that would result in the robot falling from the table must be prevented, however further valid movement commands must still
be allowed.

Detailed [requirements](Requirements.md) are provided.

## Why?

Practice makes perfect! I'm going to be interviewing and a few exercies like this can't hurt.
